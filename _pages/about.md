Hello there! My name is Lizhi Yang. I graduated from the EECS department of UC Berkeley in spring 2022 and am currently transitioning towards my graduate studies as a **Mechanical Engineering PhD student at Caltech**. My research interests are in **legged robotics**, **control** and **machine learning**. Apart from my research, I am engaged in STEM outreach, and was involved in groups such as [Pioneers in Engineering](https://pioneers.berkeley.edu/). In life I am a tech enthusiast and sci-fi lover. My CV is linked [here](/assets/pdf/Yang_Lizhi_CV.pdf). If you are interested in talking with me, please feel free to contact me at the email at the bottom of the page!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
